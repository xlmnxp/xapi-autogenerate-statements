# Statement Generator

The generator tool has been updated to use [xapi launch](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-launch). If you are running the tool without launch, don't forget to include the workshop context id. The default id is, http://adlnet.gov/event/xapiworkshop/myworkshop, and is used by the graphs to display the LRS data. This is done so data doesn't get mixed up between various workshops being presented.

Simply click the `Insert Workshop Context` button link to include it in your statements.
