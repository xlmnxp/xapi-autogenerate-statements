# xAPI-Workshop

Included in [the Presentation folder](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Workshop/tree/master/Presentations) are resources on the following topics:

* xAPI Overview
* DODI
* Understanding an xAPI Statement
* xAPI Profiles
* xAPI Launch


Included in the [Tools folder](https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Workshop/tree/master/Tools) is a basic statement generator and reporting app. The generator allows users to easily create xAPI statements from pre-populated drop down lists and abstracts the user from the more technical side. The reporting app looks for statements related to the [French Toast jQuery Mobile app](https://github.com/adlnet/xapi-jqm).
